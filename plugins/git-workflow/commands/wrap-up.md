# Wrap-Up Command

Update CLAUDE.md and README.md files based on work done in this session.

## Usage

```
/git-workflow:wrap-up
```

## Instructions

When this command is invoked, perform the following:

### 1. Review Existing Documentation

1. Read all CLAUDE.md files throughout the project
2. Read the README.md file

### 2. Analyze Session Changes

Compare the session information with existing file contents:
- Identify new information learned during the session
- Note changes in preferences or approach
- Find important details that should be documented

### 3. Critical Analysis

Be brutally critical. Only add information if it is crucial for future reference:

- Does the new information significantly change how the project should be approached?
- Are there new preferences that contradict or update existing ones?
- Is there any information that is no longer relevant or accurate?

### 4. Update Documentation

Based on your analysis:
- Add new, relevant information
- Modify existing content to reflect changes
- Remove outdated or irrelevant information
- Maintain the overall structure and purpose of each file

### 5. Create New CLAUDE.md Files (if needed)

Use common sense to decide if additional CLAUDE.md files should be created for specific directories.

### 6. Report Changes

After making updates, briefly explain:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- What was intentionally left unchanged

## Guidelines

- Only make changes that truly enhance usefulness
- Keep documentation concise and relevant
- Maintain consistency with existing style
- If no updates are necessary, explicitly state why
